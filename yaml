## Quick next upgrades (easy wins)
If you want stars, these are the “polish multipliers”:
1. Add `--jobs`, `--parallelism`, `--seed` flags via `clap`
2. Add `tracing` spans per job with `job.id` and chosen strategy
3. Add a simple ASCII chart at the end (counts per strategy as bars)
4. Add `criterion` benchmark: naive always-spawn vs HelixRouter
